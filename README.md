Research initiative on ethics and AI in the age of automation. Seeking funding to build editorially transparent, human-centered frameworks that restore civic dignity and resist extractive systems.


# 🧠 Ethics and AI: Reclaiming Humanity in the Age of Mechanized Intelligence

Welcome to a living archive of ethical inquiry, editorial transparency, and civic imagination in the age of artificial intelligence. This repository is part of an interdisciplinary initiative that interrogates the mechanization of life through AI systems—where prediction replaces judgment, optimization eclipses empathy, and efficiency threatens dignity.

## ✨ Purpose

As AI systems increasingly shape labor, governance, and interpersonal relations, this project asks:

> What values are being encoded, and whose futures are being foreclosed?

We explore how philosophical depth, reproducible frameworks, and editorial integrity can restore ethical agency in a world dominated by algorithmic logic.
